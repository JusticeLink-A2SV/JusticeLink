# JusticeLink

## Introduction

JusticeLink is a platform designed to connect Ethiopian communities with affordable legal aid. The idea for this project was provided by A2SV and was inspired by the personal experience of an A2SVian, whose father faced significant challenges in finding affordable legal representation. This project is developed for the A2SV Internal Hackathon, with the goal of making legal assistance more accessible to those in need.

## Problem Statement

Many Ethiopian communities lack legal knowledge and have low incomes, making it difficult for them to obtain the legal aid they need. They often waste time and money trying to find affordable attorneys or legal assistance. JusticeLink aims to solve this problem by providing a platform that facilitates connections between the community and affordable attorneys, as well as legal aid organizations.

The Hague – A Justice Needs and Satisfaction Survey (JNS) conducted in 2020 by The Hague Institute for Innovation of Law (HiiL) shows that rapid development and urbanization continue to widen Ethiopia’s justice gap. Of the 7.4 million legal problems occurring in the country, 5.2 million remain unresolved or perceived as unfairly resolved.

“Legal problems in Ethiopia are relatively low compared to other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa,” said Dr. Martin Gramatikov, director of Measuring Justice at HiiL. “That said, however, addressing the high demand for access and resolution to these issues will require bold action from justice stakeholders across the country. What matters is how many legal problems Ethiopians manage to resolve fairly.”

## Proposed Solution

JusticeLink will offer the following features:

1. **Attorney Directory:** A searchable database of attorneys offering affordable and pro bono services.
2. **Legal Aid Organizations:** A directory of organizations providing free or low-cost legal services.
3. **User Profiles:** Allow users to create profiles, manage their case details, and securely upload legal documents.
4. **Information Hub:** A resource center with articles, FAQs, and guides on common legal issues.
5. **Matching System:** An algorithm that matches users with attorneys based on their needs and the attorneys' expertise.
6. **Feedback and Rating System:** Users can rate and leave feedback for attorneys and services they receive.
7. **Text and Video Chat:** Integrated text and video chat functionality to facilitate communication between users and attorneys.
8. **AI Chat Bot:** An AI-powered chatbot to provide preliminary legal advice and assist users in navigating the platform.

## Target Users

- **Primary Users:** Low-income individuals in need of affordable legal services, attorneys willing to offer affordable or pro bono services, and legal aid organizations.
- **Secondary Users:** Anyone seeking affordable legal assistance.

## Competitors

### Local Competitors:

1. **Ethiopian Government Universities:** Provide free legal aid but face bureaucratic challenges that limit their effectiveness.
2. **Justice For All - Prison Fellowship Ethiopia:** Offers legal aid services but is primarily focused on criminal justice and prison reform.
3. **Women Lawyers Association (EWLA):** Provides legal aid to women but may have limited resources and reach.

### Global Competitors:

1. **Avvo:** Connects users with legal aid and attorneys but does not specifically focus on affordability or volunteer services as JusticeLink does.
2. **LegalZoom:** Offers online legal services and document preparation but focuses more on self-help legal services rather than connecting users with attorneys.
3. **Rocket Lawyer:** Provides online legal services and attorney consultations but tends to be more expensive and less focused on pro bono or affordable services.
4. **Lawyer.com:** Connects users with attorneys and offers a membership plan, but primarily targets higher-income users and lacks a strong focus on affordability.
5. **JustAnswer:** An online platform where users can ask legal questions to attorneys, but it does not offer comprehensive legal aid or a matching system for ongoing legal representation.

## Impact

JusticeLink aims to transform the legal landscape in Ethiopia and potentially across Africa by providing increased access to legal aid. This platform will empower individuals with the knowledge and resources needed to navigate legal challenges effectively, fostering a more just society.
